Abstract: ???

Keywords:
Multitasking, Multicore, Loosely Timed Model, Timing Budget, Static Scheduler, System Simulation, Timing Model, Hard Real Time, Model Based Development and Optimization, SystemC

## Overview
* A simulation platform for the evaluation of the scheduling and timing budget
* Simplifies the initial stages of the architecture development for Hard Real Time systems.
  * Allow for the simulation driven development and optimization of the architecture
* Flexible, highly abstract and independent of the implementation target (HW or SW)

* Input:
  * Top-level timing requirements
  * Outline of the processing flow
* Output:
  * Processing schedule and timing diagrams
  * List of the execution blocks and common resources as well as the requirements for both

* Benefits of using SystemC
  * Reduced update-simulation-analysis cycle which allows for simulation driven development and optimization of the architecture
  * High level of abstraction for the scheduler and execution core preferences to stay focused on the architectural tasks
  * Integration into the existing simulation frameworks and workflows
  * Open source

## Simulated System
### System Model
* Real-Time System is simulated as a number of concurrently running **Threads**
* Each **Thread** is a succession of the **Tasks** to execute and the **Events** to generate
* New **Thread** is initiated when the specific set of the **Events** has been generated 
  * Thread synchronization
* Each **Task** is a specification of
  * Execution time, 
  * Set of the **Execution Blocks** to be occupied for the duration of the execution time, and
  * Demand requested from the **Common Resources** by the **Execution Blocks** from the set.
* Competition for the **Execution Block** is resolved by the priorities which were specified in the **Thread** preferences

### Execution Blocks and Common Resources
* Each Common Resource simulates an instance which is shared by multiple Execution Blocks in the cooperative manner.
* The Common Resource is characterized by its capacity
* Examples
  * Shared memory interface with throughput limit. Capacity: _max throughput_.
  * Power source with the current limit. Capacity: _max current_.

### Planner
* Executes multiple concurrent Threads
* Keeps the register of the Events generated by the running Threads
  * Events are used for the synchronization between the Threads 
* Assigns the available Execution Blocks to the Tasks which are called by the running Threads 
  * Resolves Thread priorities
* Transmits runtime configuration to the Execution Blocks and receives their state
  * Keeps the record of the available and busy Execution Blocks
  
### Execution Block
* Receives runtime configuration from the Planner
* Transmits requests with the demand values to the Common Resources
* Receives the information from the Common Resource about its total demand, combines the information from the multiple Common Resources and adjusts the execution time accordingly
* Transmits “available” status to the Planner when the execution time is expired

### Common Resource
* Receives requests with the demand values from the Execution Blocks
* Calculates total demand requested by all of the Execution Blocks which are using this Resource
* Broadcasts the value of the total demand to all of the Execution Blocks which are using this Resource
